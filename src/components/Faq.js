                    You will need a Solana compatible wallet, our recommended
                    choice is Phantom. You will need to fund your Solana wallet
                    with enough SOL to mint the amount of Martians you would
                    like to acquire and to cover transaction costs. Once minted
                    Martians will display within your Phantom wallet under the
                    collectibles tab. Hereâ€™s a great introductory video tutorial
                    on getting started with Solana wallet.

                    Why Was The Solana Blockchain Chosen?

                  <Accordion.Body>
                    We chose Solana based on faster confirmation times, and
                    lower transaction costs than Ethereum. In addition the
                    soon-to-be launched Martian Madness game will be a much more
                    enjoyable experience on the Solana blockchain.

                  <Accordion.Body>
                    As many as you would like, unlike Ethereum where batch mints
                    were introduced to overcome the rising gas fees, Solana is
                    not hampered by the same limitations.
